# My Personal Profile using Gatsby
Visit the website [here](98sean98.github.io).
It's awesome.

Credits to [Utkarsh Goel](https://github.com/utkarsh867) for designing the website, and letting me use it as well.

A [template](https://github.com/rcltech/gatsby_cv_template) for this CV is also provided under [RC Tech club](https://www.rctech.club/), which I have helped co-founding.

### Build and Host on Github Pages
Tell Gatsby to build a proper website into the `public` directory.
```
gatsby build
```

Push to github repo containing github pages.
```
gh-pages -d public/ -r https://github.com/98sean98/98sean98.github.io.git -b master
```
